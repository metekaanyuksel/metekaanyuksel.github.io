I use mechanistic mathematical models, genomic data (broadly defined!), and computational statistical tools to answer biological questions.

One of the problems I am most interested in right now is the evolution of recombination. This is one of the oldest puzzles in evolutionary biology --- why do organisms fuse gametes and recombine genetic material when there is a two-fold cost compared to asexuality --- and there is a rich theoretical literature on the subject.

- The observation that recombination varies dramatically along the genome (at fine and coarse scales), across individuals (i.e., gametes), between sexes, between populations, and between species[^1] motivates a lot of the work that I have been doing.

- One reason it is difficult to understand the causes and consequences of variation in recombination (which is the raw material on which evolution can act!) is that the phenotype is effectively infinite-dimensional. The recombination landscape on the chromosome is best thought of as a function of genomic location, with co-variances at all pairs of locations that constrain how it can evolve. With Puneeth Deraje, I've been working on a mechanistic model that describes how this function evolves under neutrality (i.e., drift and cis modifier accumulation). We have shown that, in a finite population, the mean CDF of recombination follows a certain Gaussian process. We are currently using comparative data to make inferences (under this model) about the tempo and mode of landscape evolution, i.e., the manner in which modifiers accumulate.

My other main scientific interest is virus evolution. RNA viruses are so rapidly evolving that, by conventional metrics of the rate of molecular evolution, their genomes should turnover _neutrally_ in $\sim 10^3$ years. Isn't that remarkable! I am interested in understanding how they make a living, how recombination shapes their evolution and propensity to successfully spillover and emerge in humans[^2], and other aspects of their weird biology.

- Avian influenza poses a potential problem to human health and evolution in avian and mammalian hosts will be a key determinant of if/when it successfully jumps into humans. What species will host the genotypes that successfully establish in human? Do available sequence data tell us anything about the potential for reassortment within and between sub-types (i.e., the different Hs and Ns)? These are questions that I've been thinking about.

- Although we know recombination and reassortment are common in RNA viruses and of concern for human health, their evolution is not particularly well-understood. An especially interesting alternative to the idea reassortment evolved to shuffle genetic material is that it is a necessary byproduct of the segmented nature of some viral genomes (i.e., that genes are encoded on different segments and this allows for finer control over gene expression in host cells). Weighing the shuffling and gene expression control hypotheses is a problem I am very interested in. If this interests you, please get in touch!


[^1]: In fact, there is a remarkable experiment showing that the gene, PRDM9, that determines where recombination occurs on the genome (i.e., the set of recombination _hotspots_) in many vertebrates underlies the formation of different species to begin with ðŸ˜±.
